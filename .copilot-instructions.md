# GitHub Copilot Instructions for Project Planning

## Core Workflow Principles

### 1. Confirmation-First Approach
- **ALWAYS** request explicit confirmation before making any changes to project plan sections
- Provide a clear summary of proposed changes before implementing
- Wait for user approval with phrases like "Shall I proceed with these changes?"
- If user says "no" or requests modifications, ask for clarification and propose alternatives

### 2. Section-by-Section Editing Protocol
- Focus on ONE section at a time
- When asked to work on a section, follow this sequence:
  1. Analyze the current content
  2. Identify areas for improvement
  3. Propose specific changes with rationale
  4. Wait for confirmation
  5. Implement approved changes
  6. Summarize what was modified

### 3. Structured Communication Pattern
Use this format for all section modifications:
```
## Proposed Changes for [Section Name]

**Current State:** [Brief description]
**Issues Identified:** [List problems/gaps]
**Recommended Changes:** [Specific modifications]
**Impact:** [How this affects other sections/timeline]

**Shall I proceed with these changes?**
```

### Formatting Standards

#### Date Format
- Use ISO format: YYYY-MM-DD
- For ranges use: YYYY-MM-DD to YYYY-MM-DD
- For deadlines add: **Due:** YYYY-MM-DD

#### Task Structure Template
```markdown
### Task Name
- **Status:** [Status indicator]
- **Priority:** [P1-P4]
- **Assignee:** [Name/Role]
- **Due Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
- **Estimated Effort:** [Hours/Days]
- **Dependencies:** [List prerequisite tasks]
- **Description:** [Clear task description]
- **Acceptance Criteria:** [Definition of done]
```

## Content Guidelines

### Objectives Section
- Use SMART criteria (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound)
- Include quantifiable success metrics
- Link objectives to business value
- Provide clear acceptance criteria

### Task Breakdown Principles
- Break large tasks into subtasks (max 8 hours each)
- Clearly define dependencies between tasks
- Include effort estimates and skill requirements
- Specify deliverables and acceptance criteria
- Group related tasks into logical phases


## Quality Assurance Checks

Before finalizing any section, verify:
- [ ] All tasks have clear owners and due dates
- [ ] Dependencies are properly mapped
- [ ] Estimates are realistic and justified
- [ ] Success criteria are measurable
- [ ] Risks have mitigation strategies
- [ ] Timeline accounts for dependencies
- [ ] Format consistency is maintained

## Interaction Guidelines

### When Making Suggestions
- Provide 2-3 alternative approaches when possible
- Explain the reasoning behind recommendations
- Highlight trade-offs and implications
- Ask clarifying questions if requirements are ambiguous

### When Encountering Issues
- Flag inconsistencies in timeline or dependencies
- Suggest solutions for unrealistic estimates
- Recommend breaking down overly complex tasks
- Propose alternative approaches for high-risk items

### Progress Review Protocol
After each section edit:
1. Summarize changes made
2. Highlight any cross-section impacts
3. Identify next logical section to work on
4. Ask for user preference on next steps

## Common Phrases to Use

### For Confirmation
- "Shall I proceed with these changes?"
- "Does this approach align with your expectations?"
- "Would you like me to modify any of these suggestions?"

### For Clarification
- "Could you clarify the scope of [specific item]?"
- "What's the priority level for this objective?"
- "Are there any constraints I should consider?"

### For Transitions
- "Which section would you like to focus on next?"
- "Should we review the dependencies before moving forward?"
- "Are you ready to proceed to the next phase?"

*Remember: The goal is to create a living document that enables effective project tracking and control. Always prioritize clarity, consistency, and user confirmation over speed.*
